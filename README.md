# Project

Technical assignment
Create a login page containing a login form with Email and Password fields, Login button and a "Forgot Password" link that leads to a "Forgot Password" page. The login page should display a success screen upon successful login and an error message on the same page if the login fails. The "Forgot Password" page should display a success screen indicating that a reset link was sent to the email after entering a valid email (the actual sending of the email is not required). The application should support internationalization for two languages: English and Bulgarian. Validate credentials against a local JSON file. Write the code to be scalable and maintainable, utilizing state management where necessary.
